            parent (:class:`str`):
                Required. Resource name of the tenant under which the
                company is created.

                The format is
                "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}", for
                example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar".
                This corresponds to the ``parent`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:

                The List companies response object.
